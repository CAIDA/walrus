                         Walrus 0.6.2 Source Code
                               Feb 20, 2003


Walrus classes are declared in the top-level anonymous package, so you
can unpack the source distribution anywhere.

To build Walrus, the following items must be added to your CLASSPATH:
libsea.jar, antlrall-mod.jar, mp.jar, and the directory containing the
Walrus source files.  For example, if the Walrus source distribution
has been unpacked into the directory /home/me, then the items to add
to your CLASSPATH are

   /home/me/walrus-0.6.2-src/libsea.jar
   /home/me/walrus-0.6.2-src/antlrall-mod.jar
   /home/me/walrus-0.6.2-src/mp.jar
   .    [a period, representing the 'current directory']

Under UNIX, you would do something like the following (the exact
syntax is dependent on your shell):

  CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/home/me/walrus-0.6.2-src/libsea.jar:/home/me/walrus-0.6.2-src/antlrall-mod.jar:/home/me/walrus-0.6.2-src/mp.jar:.
  export CLASSPATH

The '.' at the end of the above CLASSPATH ensures that Java can find
the Walrus source/class files.

Besides the above changes to CLASSPATH, you may need to modify the
symbol JAVA_INSTALL in the makefile (walrus-0.6.2-src/Walrus/Makefile).

You'll need JDK1.3.0 (or later), GNU Make, and the IBM Jikes compiler.
Jikes is used to automatically generate dependency files (*.u files)
for Make.  You can get Jikes from

  http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/

You do not need to install Jikes if you simply want to build Walrus from
the source, since the source distribution contains a copy of the dependency
files that can be used so long as no source file is modified.

When everything is set, you can simply do 'make' in the 'Walrus' directory
to build Walrus.
