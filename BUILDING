                         Walrus 0.6.2 Source Code
                               Feb 20, 2003


To build Walrus, you'll need JDK1.3.0 (or later), GNU Make, and the IBM
Jikes compiler.  Jikes is used to automatically generate dependency files
(*.u files) for Make.  You can get Jikes from

  http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/

All the classes of Walrus are in the top-level anonymous package, so you
can unpack the archive wherever you wish.

To build and run Walrus, you'll need to add to your CLASSPATH the
libsea.jar and antlrall-mod.jar files.  Also, you'll need to modify,
if needed, the symbol JAVA_INSTALL in the makefile.

When everything is set, you can simply do 'make' to build Walrus.
