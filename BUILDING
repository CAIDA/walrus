                         Walrus 0.6.2 Source Code
                               Feb 20, 2003


All the classes of Walrus are in the top-level anonymous package, so you
can unpack the source distribution wherever you wish.

To build and run Walrus, you'll need to add to your CLASSPATH the files
libsea.jar, antlrall-mod.jar, and mp.jar.  Also, you'll need to modify,
if needed, the symbol JAVA_INSTALL in the makefile.

Also, you'll need JDK1.3.0 (or later), GNU Make, and the IBM Jikes
compiler.  Jikes is used to automatically generate dependency files (*.u
files) for Make.  You can get Jikes from

  http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/

You do not need to install Jikes if you simply want to build Walrus from
the source.  The source distribution contains a copy of the dependency
files that can be used so long as no source file is modified.

When everything is set, you can simply do 'make' to build Walrus.
