                              WALRUS TODO


=========================================================================
BUGS & ISSUES
=========================================================================

* Improve memory usage in H3RenderQueue and H3Transformer.  The use of longs
  was an expedient that is now past its usefulness.

* Owing to a AWT/Java3D/Swing bug, none of the keyboard accelerators for
  the menus work.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, the display tends to flicker when a user interacts
  with the menus.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, depth cueing can't be disabled with
  Rendering->Depth Cueing.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, antialiasing doesn't work in immediate mode,
  the mode used by Walrus.

* Node labels of list type aren't currently displayed in the status bar.

* With very large graphs (~1 million nodes), precision problems can corrupt
  the display during naviagation.

* It can be slow loading large (50-80MB) graphs, and Walrus provides no
  feedback during the load (such as with a progress bar).


=========================================================================
FEATURES
=========================================================================

* Add some perceptually uniform colorscales.

* Implement the Selection Attribute menu item under the Color Scheme menu.

* Selecting the nonadaptive rendering algorithm causes a fixed color scheme
  to take effect.  Change this to work like the adaptive algorithm.

* Implement File->Save with Layout and File->Save with Layout As.

* Implement File->Preferences.
