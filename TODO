                              WALRUS TODO


=========================================================================
BUGS & ISSUES
=========================================================================

* Sometimes the display is only partially redrawn after the user changes
  the configuration and selects Rendering->Update.  I suspect Walrus is
  losing track of the node currently at the center of the display.  The
  renderer traverses the graph starting at this central node.

  A workaround is to right-click the node at center of the display (or even
  any visible node).

* The transparency option in the Color Scheme menu doesn't work quite as
  expected.  It makes the last selected color transparent, so users have
  to take two steps to get the transparent color they want.  The problem
  is that transparency should be an _attribute_ of a color and not a color
  itself (the menu item should be turned into a checkbox that may be selected
  in addition to a color).

* Improve memory usage in H3RenderQueue and H3Transformer.  The use of longs
  was an expedient that is now past its usefulness.

* Owing to a AWT/Java3D/Swing bug, none of the keyboard accelerators for
  the menu items work.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, the display may flicker when a user interacts with
  the menus.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, depth cueing can't be disabled with
  Rendering->Depth Cueing.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, antialiasing doesn't work in immediate mode,
  which is the mode used by Walrus.

FEATURES
=========================================================================

* Add menu items and/or keyboard commands to control wobbling, screen
  capture, and recording.  Remove the current bindings to mouse controls.

* Revamp the Color Scheme menu.  Remove 'Hot to Cold', 'Logarithmic HtoC',
  and 'Hue' menu items.  Add some perceptually uniform colorscales.
  Make a better set of fixed colors and predefined color schemes.

* Implement the Selection Attribute menu item in Color Scheme.

* Selecting the nonadaptive rendering algorithm causes a fixed color scheme
  to take effect.  Change this to work like the adaptive algorithm.

* Implement File->Save with Layout and File->Save with Layout As.

* Implement File->Preferences.
