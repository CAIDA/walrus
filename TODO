                              WALRUS TODO


=========================================================================
BUGS & ISSUES
=========================================================================

* It can be slow (say, 5 minutes) loading large (50-80MB) graphs, and
  Walrus provides no feedback during the load (such as with a progress bar).

* Rotations stop working when you disable coordinate axes while using
  the nonadaptive render loop.

* With very large graphs (~1 million nodes), precision problems can corrupt
  the display during navigation.

* After a user resizes the Walrus window by clicking the zoom
  (or minimize/maximize) button on the window, picking may become
  inaccurate, and depth cueing may disappear.  This is likely caused by
  an apparent bug in Java3D in which a movement of the viewer's eye isn't
  immediately reflected in internal transformation matrices.  Simply
  navigating around the graph usually fixes this problem.

* Owing to a AWT/Java3D/Swing bug, none of the keyboard accelerators for
  the menus work.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, the display tends to flicker when a user interacts
  with the menus.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, depth cueing can't be disabled with
  Rendering->Depth Cueing.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, antialiasing doesn't work in immediate mode,
  the mode used by Walrus.

* Improve memory usage in H3RenderQueue and H3Transformer.
