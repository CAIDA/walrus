BUGS & ISSUES
=========================================================================

* The transparency option in the Color Scheme menu doesn't work quite as
  expected.  It makes the last selected color transparent, so users have
  to take two steps to get the transparent color they want.  The problem
  is that transparency should be an _attribute_ of a color and not a color
  itself (the menu item should be turned into a checkbox that may be selected
  in addition to a color).

* Improve memory usage in H3RenderQueue and H3Transformer.  The use of longs
  was an expedient that is now past its usefulness.

* Owing to a AWT/Java3D/Swing bug, none of the keyboard accelerators for
  the menus work.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, the display tends to flicker when a user interacts
  with the menus.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, depth cueing can't be disabled with
  Rendering->Depth Cueing.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, antialiasing doesn't work in immediate mode,
  the mode used by Walrus.

* The code that writes screenshots to files uses a hardcoded image size.

* Node labels of list type aren't currently displayed in the status bar.

* Doing Rendering->Update causes information about the previously visited
  node (for bringing back to the center with shift-middle-mouse button)
  to be lost.

* With very large graphs (~1 million nodes), precision problems can corrupt
  the display during naviagation.

* It can be slow loading large (50-80MB) graphs, and Walrus provides no
  feedback during the load (such as with a progress bar).

FEATURES
=========================================================================

* Add menu items and/or keyboard commands to control wobbling, screen
  capture, and recording.  Remove the current bindings to mouse controls.

* Revamp the Color Scheme menu.  Add some perceptually uniform colorscales.
  Make a better set of fixed colors and predefined color schemes.

* Implement the Selection Attribute menu item in Color Scheme.

* Selecting the nonadaptive rendering algorithm causes a fixed color scheme
  to take effect.  Change this to work like the adaptive algorithm.

* Implement File->Save with Layout and File->Save with Layout As.

* Implement File->Preferences.
