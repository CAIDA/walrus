                              WALRUS TODO


=========================================================================
BUGS & ISSUES
=========================================================================

* It can be slow (say, 5 minutes) loading large (50-80MB) graphs, and
  Walrus provides no feedback during the load (such as with a progress bar).

* With very large graphs (> ~500k nodes), the display may become
  corrupted during navigation.

* Owing to a AWT/Java3D/Swing bug, none of the keyboard accelerators for
  the menus work.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, the display tends to flicker when a user interacts
  with the menus.

* Owing to a Java3D bug, antialiasing doesn't work in immediate mode,
  the mode used by Walrus.

* Improve memory usage in H3RenderQueue and H3Transformer.


=========================================================================
FEATURES
=========================================================================

* Add some perceptually uniform colorscales.

* Implement File->Save with Layout and File->Save with Layout As.

* Implement File->Preferences.
